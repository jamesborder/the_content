"Character viewer content package"

## Getting Started

This project is responsible for the content of the "The Simpsons" and "The Wire" character viewer apps. 
It is a package that can be used by other apps to display the content of the character viewer. 

It will be included in the "The Simpsons" and "The Wire" character viewer apps as a dependency or can be launched as a standalone app and will display "The Simpsons" content by default.
